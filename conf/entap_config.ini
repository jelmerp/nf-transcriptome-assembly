#When using this ini file keep the following in mind:
#	1. Do not edit the input keys to the left side of the '=' sign
#	2. Be sure to use the proper value type (either a string, list, or number)
#	3. Do not add unecessary spaces to your input
#	4. When inputting a list, only add a ',' between each entry

# [similarity_search]
#-------------------------------
#Specify the type of species/taxon you are analyzing and would like alignments closer in taxonomic relevance to be favored (based on NCBI Taxonomic Database)
#Note: replace all spaces with underscores '_'
taxon=
#Select the minimum query coverage to be allowed during similarity searching
qcoverage=50
#Select the minimum target coverage to be allowed during similarity searching
tcoverage=50
#Specify the E-Value that will be used as a cutoff during similarity searching.
e-value=1e-05
#Specify the contaminants you would like to flag for similarity searching. Contaminants can be selected by species or through a specific taxon (insecta) from the NCBI Taxonomy Database. If your taxon is more than one word just replace the spaces with underscores (_).
#Note: since hits are based upon a multitide of factors, a contaminant might end up being the best hit for an alignment. In this scenario, EnTAP will flag the contaminant and it can be removed if you would like.
#type:list (string)
contam=
#List of keywords that should be used to specify uninformativeness of hits during similarity searching. Generally something along the lines of 'hypothetical' or 'unknown' are used. Each term should be separated by a comma (,) This can be used if you would like to tag certain descriptions or would like to weigh certain alignments differently (see full documentation)
#Example (defaults): conserved, predicted, unknown, hypothetical, putative, unidentified, uncultured, uninformative, unnamed
uninformative=conserved,predicted,unknown,unnamed,hypothetical,putative,unidentified,uncharacterized,uncultured,uninformative,

# [Databases]
#-------------------------------
#Path to the EnTAP binary database
entap-db-bin=entap_database.bin
#Path to the EggNOG SQL database that was downloaded during the Configuration stage.
eggnog-sql=eggnog.db
#Path to EggNOG DIAMOND configured database that was generated during the Configuration stage.
eggnog-dmnd=eggnog_proteins.dmnd

# [expression_analysis]
#-------------------------------
#Specify the FPKM threshold with expression analysis. EnTAP will filter out transcripts below this value. (default: 0.5)
fpkm=0.5
#Specify this flag if your BAM/SAM file was generated through single-end reads
single-end=false

# [frame_selection]
#-------------------------------
#Select this option if all of your sequences are complete proteins.
#At this point, this option will merely flag the sequences in your output file
complete=false
#Specify the Frame Selection software you would like to use. Only one flag can be specified.
#Specify flags as follows:
#    1. GeneMarkS-T
#    2. Transdecoder (default)
frame-selection=2

# [frame_selection-transdecoder]
#-------------------------------
#Transdecoder only. Specify the minimum protein length
#type:integer
transdecoder-m=100
#Specify this flag if you would like to pipe the TransDecoder command '--no_refine_starts' when it is executed. Default: False
#This will 'start refinement identifies potential start codons for 5' partial ORFs using a PWM, process on by default.' 
#type:boolean (true/false)
transdecoder-no-refine-starts=false

# [general]
#-------------------------------
#Specify the output format for the processed alignments.Multiple flags can be specified:
#    1. TSV Format (default)
#    2. CSV Format
#    3. FASTA Amino Acid (default)
#    4. FASTA Nucleotide (default)
#    5. Gene Enrichment Sequence ID vs. Effective Length TSV (default)
#    6. Gene Enrichment Sequence ID vs. GO Term TSV (default)
#type:list (integer)
output-format=1,3,4,5,6,

# [ontology]
#-------------------------------
# Specify the ontology software you would like to use
#Note: it is possible to specify more than one! Just usemultiple --ontology flags
#Specify flags as follows:
#    0. EggNOG (default)
#    1. InterProScan
#type:list (integer)
ontology=0,
#Specify the Gene Ontology levels you would like printed
#A level of 0 means that every term will be printed, while a level of 1 or higher
#means that that level and anything higher than it will be printed
#It is possible to specify multiple flags as well
#Example/Defaults: --level 0 --level 1
#type:list (integer)
level=0,1,2,3

# [ontology-interproscan]
#-------------------------------
#Select which databases you would like for InterProScan. Databases must be one of the following:
#    -tigrfam
#    -sfld
#    -prodom
#    -hamap
#    -pfam
#    -smart
#    -cdd
#    -prositeprofiles
#    -prositepatterns
#    -superfamily
#    -prints
#    -panther
#    -gene3d
#    -pirsf
#    -coils
#    -morbidblite
#Make sure the database is downloaded, EnTAP will not check!
#--protein tigrfam --protein pfam
#type:list (string)
protein=

#-------------------------------
# [configuration]
#-------------------------------
#Specify which EnTAP database you would like to download/generate or use throughout execution. Only one is required.
#    0. Serialized Database (default)
#    1. SQLITE Database
#It is advised to use the default Serialized Database as this is fastest.
